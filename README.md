# spherical_image_editing
Editing spherical images/video using MÃ¶bius transformations


This is a fork of an original codebase by Henry Segerman. The droste effect he created with eleVR allowed a panorama to recurse into itself using Mobius transformations.

Here, the code is adapted to allow one panorama to transition into another panorama, via Mobius transformations. The code can generate an animation (as a series of images) that transitions from one equirectangular image to another.

To generate a single frame in the animation, call the generate_image function in sphere_transforms.py, like this:

```python
generate_image(pano_A_zoom_centre, zoom_factor, zoom_cutoff, pano_A_filename, rotated_pano_B_filename, out_x_size, zoom_loop_value, save_filename)
```

The parameters are:
* pano_A_zoom_centre: the x position (in pixels) on the origin panoramic image where you want the destination panorama to appear (usually, where in virtual space the destination is from your current location)
* zoom_factor: how zoomed in you want the destination panorama to start
* pano_A_filename: file name of the origin panoramic image (equirectangular)
* rotated_pano_B_filename: the file name of the destination panoramic image. Note that this panorama must be rotated so the "forward" direction in both panoramas align (if this isn't the case, use rotate_equirect_image() in sphere_transforms.py to rotate the panorama to align)
* out_x_size: how big you want the output image to be
* zoom_loop_value: a value from 0 to 1 that specifies how far through the animation you are. A value of 0 means you're fully in the origin panorama, a value of 1 means you're fully in the destination panorama. During animation, this value ranges from 0 to 1, increasing 1/numFrames per frame.
* save_filename: the file where you want the generated frame to go
